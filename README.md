Productive Maintenance &amp; Autonomous Service Scheduling Systems For Automotive OEMs  ---

## 🧠 Overview

**AgentFleet AI** is a complete **Predictive Maintenance and Autonomous Service Scheduling System** built for **automotive OEMs** operating in the **Industry 4.0 ecosystem**.  
It leverages **telematics data**, **digital twins**, and **agentic AI** to eliminate unplanned downtime, optimize service operations, and create a **continuous improvement feedback loop** between field data and manufacturing design.

---

## ⚙️ Problem Statement

Automotive OEMs today face major inefficiencies due to:

- 🚨 **Reactive maintenance** strategies leading to high repair costs and customer dissatisfaction.  
- 📅 **Manual service scheduling** causing unbalanced workshop loads and missed slots.  
- 🔄 **Lost design insights** — field failures rarely reach the R&D and design teams.

## 🚀 Our Solution

AgentFleet AI transforms raw vehicle telemetry into **actionable intelligence** through a **fully autonomous, data-driven pipeline**:

### 🧩 Predictive Analytics Engine  
Detects early signs of component wear, vibration anomalies, and failure trends in real time using:
- **Sensor Fusion**  
- **AI Models (LSTM, degradation models)**  

### 🤖 Autonomous Scheduling System  
A **multi-agent optimizer** that proactively books maintenance slots, considering:
- Vehicle health  
- Location  
- Severity of issues  
- Workshop load and availability  

### 🛰️ Digital Twin Dashboard  
A real-time visual interface showing:
- Fleet-wide health  
- Part lifecycle curves  
- Predictive repair timelines  
Continuously syncs with live telemetry for accurate performance forecasting.

### 🔁 Data Feedback Loop Integration  
Automatically sends recurring defect data to **OEM design and R&D teams**, ensuring:
- Faster design iterations  
- Smarter next-gen product improvements  

### 💬 Customer Engagement Layer  
An **intelligent assistant** that:
- Alerts users about maintenance  
- Confirms bookings automatically  
- Handles full end-to-end service coordination via **mobile or in-vehicle interface**
